Key Concepts Demonstrated
1. Safe Math Operations
checked_add and checked_sub prevent overflows/underflows by returning Option<T>
None is returned when an operation would overflow/underflow
Some(value) is returned when the operation succeeds

2. Option Type
Used to handle values that might not exist
Pattern matching with match to handle both cases
unwrap_or() to provide a default value

3. Error Handling with Result
Result<T, E> represents operations that might fail
Ok(value) for success, Err(error) for failure
Pattern matching to handle different outcomes
The ? operator for concise error propagation

These concepts are crucial in Substrate development because:
Blockchain code must be extremely robust against errors
Overflows could lead to security vulnerabilities
Proper error handling improves user experience
